## Introduction

We propose a Poisson blending loss that achieves the same purpose of Poisson Image Editing. We jointly optimize the proposed Poisson blending loss with style and content loss computed from a deep network, and reconstruct the blending region by iteratively updating the pixels using the L-BFGS solver. In the blending image, we not only smooth out gradient domain of the blending boundary but also add consistent texture into the blending region.

## Usage
This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies; start by install poetry and then dependencies

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```
Once this is done you can run the example. Please check the arguments in the code for you application. 

```bash
poetry run python run.py
# check arguments
poetry run python run.py --help
```
